      <h2>Problem at Scale</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>The core promise of our health insurance product is cashless service. measurable number of in-clinic consultations were conducted through non-network hospitals. These providers could not offer our credit line, forcing us into complex workarounds that destroyed the customer experience and burdened our operations.</p>
        
        <p>Prior to the Scan and Pay initiative, we were facing three critical issues:</p>
        
        <h3>High Operational Dependency & Cost</h3>
        <p>For bookings with non-network providers, our system took the consultation request for free. However, our internal Operations team had to manually call the hospital, book the slot, and use company funds via UPI/wallet to pay for the service on the customer's behalf. This process was manual, non-scalable, and costly.</p>
        
        <h3>Credit/Payment Scrambles</h3>
        <p>In other scenarios, our operations agent was forced to ask the patient—who was already at the clinic—to send a payment QR code so the agent could pay remotely. This introduced risk and frustration.</p>
        
        <h3>The 90-Second Failure Point</h3>
        <p>The most critical issue was that the hospital's dynamic QR code, typically generated by a Point-of-Sale (POS) machine, had an expiration window of just 90 seconds. This often resulted in the payment failing, leaving the customer agitated and the agent scrambling, completely defeating the purpose of a seamless, cashless experience.</p>
        
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Problem Area</th>
            <th>Current State</th>
            <th>Impact</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Payment Processing</td>
            <td>Manual agent intervention</td>
            <td>High operational cost, scalability issues</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>QR Code Expiry</td>
            <td>90-second window</td>
            <td>Payment failures, customer frustration</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>User Experience</td>
            <td>Complex workarounds</td>
            <td>Poor satisfaction, cancellations</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p><strong>Target Metric to Improve:</strong> Time to Successful Payment at Non-Network Clinics (currently unreliable and high) and Operations Team Effort per Booking (currently high).</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Discovery & Research: Speed, Trust, and Fraud Prevention</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Hypothesis & Core Requirement</h3>
        <p>The initial hypothesis was that the operational overhead and poor UX could be solved by transferring the payment action directly to the user at the point of service. However, the critical challenge was the 90-second expiration window of the hospital's dynamic QR code.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The core product requirement:</strong> A seamless, in-app "Scan and Pay" feature that allows the user to successfully scan a UPI QR code and authorize payment within the 90-second window, without alarming the patient that funds were being deducted from their personal account.</p>
        
        <h3>Addressing Technical and Fraud Hurdles</h3>
        <p>To achieve speed and maintain trust, two major technical hurdles were identified:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Dynamic Payment Failure:</strong> The hospital's POS dynamic QR codes frequently failed if the exact amount wasn't entered or if the payment was slightly delayed. The solution required simplifying the payment flow while making the payment reliable for the specific, latest consultation price.</li>
          <li><strong>Fraud Prevention:</strong> Since any hospital could accept any amount through a generic QR, we implemented a crucial fraud preventive measure: The system was updated to fetch the latest, verified consultation price directly from the hospital's records and would only authorize a payment for that precise, pre-approved amount.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Stakeholder Alignment</h3>
        <p>Extensive research and scoping were conducted across four key departments:</p>
        
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Department</th>
            <th>Key Insights</th>
            <th>Action Items</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Operations Team</td>
            <td>Edge cases and failure scenarios</td>
            <td>Map payment failures, partial payments, cancellation flows</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Customer Support</td>
            <td>User sentiment and anxiety points</td>
            <td>Define reassurance messaging around money deduction</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Finance Team</td>
            <td>Legal constraints and compliance</td>
            <td>Payment gateway architecture, vendor onboarding</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Design Team</td>
            <td>Low-anxiety interface needs</td>
            <td>Clear visual cues for insurance credit vs bank account</td>
          </tr>

      <h2>The Solution & Execution: The Scan and Pay Feature</h2>
      <img src="attached_assets/placeholder2.svg" alt="Agile Product Development" style="width:100%;border-radius:12px;border:1px solid var(--border);" />
      <div class="card">
        <p>The solution was the development and launch of an integrated "Scan and Pay" feature within the mobile application, transforming a manual, costly operational flow into a direct, scalable, and cashless digital service for non-network hospitals.</p>
        
        <h3>The New Cashless Flow Architecture</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Booking and Pre-verification:</strong> The user books the consultation slot via the app. The system immediately pre-fetches the validated price and sets the payment amount.</li>
          <li><strong>Point-of-Service Action:</strong> On the day of the appointment, the in-app Scan and Pay feature is activated. The user can scan the hospital's UPI QR code. The payment amount is locked to the pre-verified consultation fee.</li>
          <li><strong>Payment and Confirmation:</strong> The payment is processed instantly via the integrated gateway. The user receives a clear, non-alarming success message confirming the amount was credited to the hospital.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Prioritization and Scope Management</h3>
        <p>Given the urgent need for a solution and the sensitive nature of financial transactions, the prioritization strategy focused intensely on reliability and speed to market:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Focus on Core Reliability:</strong> We consciously de-prioritized secondary features like geo-location-enabled payment locking or complex real-time fraud checks.</li>
          <li><strong>Vendor and MVP Integration:</strong> Vendor selection and API integration were the highest priority, focusing on the 90-second transaction window requirement.</li>
          <li><strong>Iterative Error Handling:</strong> Initial release solved top failure scenarios, with long-tail error codes addressed in subsequent sprints.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Results & Impact: Delivering Seamless Cashless Service</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>The launch of the "Scan and Pay" feature successfully achieved its primary goal: transforming a high-friction, high-cost operational workflow into a smooth, scalable, customer-driven cashless experience.</p>

      <h2>Learnings & Next Steps: Reflection and Strategy</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Key Lessons Learned</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Prioritizing Speed Over Perfection in FinTech:</strong> For critical user problems involving real money, focus on robust guardrails and loss limits rather than waiting for a "perfect" system</li>
          <li><strong>Mapping Cross-Functional Dependency:</strong> A seemingly simple solution required deep involvement of Operations, Finance, Legal, Customer Support, and Engineering</li>
          <li><strong>Building Trust and Respect:</strong> Successful execution and measurable impact resulted in strong relationships with end-users and core stakeholders</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Future Product Strategy</h3>
        <p><strong>Next Step:</strong> The "Scan and Pay" capability will be extended to other offsite services that currently rely on manual, non-cashless payments, such as diagnostic labs, pharmacies, and specialty healthcare services.</p>
