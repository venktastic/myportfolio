| **Role** | Product Manager |
| **Timeline** | X Months (or X Sprints) |
| **The Big Picture** | Solved the critical pain point of cashless payment failure at non-network hospitals by introducing a customer-driven, **in-app Scan and Pay feature**, which eliminated operational risk, boosted revenue by X**%**, and secured **100% feature adoption** among target users. |
| **Key Skills Showcased** | **MVP Definition, Fraud Prevention (Guardrails), Stakeholder Management, User Experience Design, Payment Gateway Integration.** |

## üöÄ The Challenge: Bridging the Cashless Gap

The core promise of our health insurance product is **cashless service**. However, a significant portion of our services, specifically **X% of in-clinic consultations**, were conducted through non-network hospitals. These providers could not offer our credit line, forcing us into complex workarounds that destroyed the customer experience and burdened our operations.

### The Painful Status Quo

Prior to the **Scan and Pay** initiative, we were facing three critical issues that led to terrible UX and high operational costs:

1. **High Operational Dependency & Cost:** Our Operations team had to **manually intervene** by calling the hospital, booking the slot, and using company funds via UPI to pay for the service on the customer's behalf‚Äîa non-scalable and costly process.
2. **The 90-Second Failure Point:** The critical issue was that the hospital's dynamic QR code, generated by a POS machine, had an expiration window of just **90 seconds**. This frequently led to payment failure, leaving the customer agitated and the agent scrambling.
3. **Liquidity & Trust Issue:** Patients had to be involved in the payment process (sending QR codes), but the complexity and failure rate meant the service was neither smooth nor trustworthy.

**Target Metric to Improve:** **Time to Successful Payment at Non-Network Clinics** (currently unreliable) and **Operations Team Effort per Booking** (currently high).

## üî¨ Discovery & Research: Speed, Trust, and Fraud Prevention

### Hypothesis & Core Requirement

The initial hypothesis was that the operational overhead could be solved by transferring the payment action directly to the user at the point of service. The core product requirement was defined: **A seamless, in-app "Scan and Pay" feature that ensures a successful transaction within the 90-second window, without alarming the patient that funds were being deducted from their personal account.**

### Addressing Technical and Fraud Hurdles

To ensure speed and maintain trust, two major technical hurdles were identified and addressed:

1. **Fraud Prevention:** To prevent the hospital from charging arbitrary amounts, the system was updated to **fetch the latest, verified consultation price directly from the hospital's records** and would only authorize a payment for that precise, pre-approved amount.
2. **Simplifying UX:** Extensive stakeholder interviews (Operations, Customer Support, Finance) confirmed the need for an extremely simple flow and clear visual cues to assure the user the funds were from the insurance credit line.

### Competitive Analysis

Analysis showed existing competitors relied on either **risky debt-based models** (auto-collecting reimbursement from patient accounts) or **unscalable physical concierge models**. This validated that a **direct, digital, customer-driven payment solution** was the most scalable and efficient path.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Solution & Execution: The Scan and Pay Feature

### The New Cashless Flow Architecture

The final solution focused on speed and simplicity while embedding fraud protection:

1. **Booking and Pre-verification:** User books the slot; the system pre-fetches and locks the verified payment amount.
2. **Point-of-Service Action:** The user activates the in-app **Scan and Pay feature** and scans the hospital's UPI QR code. The payment amount is fixed to the pre-verified fee.
3. **Instant Confirmation:** The payment is processed instantly. The user receives a clear **success message** confirming the funds were credited to the hospital.

### Prioritization and Scope Management

My strategy focused intensely on **reliability and speed to market (MVP)**:

- **Focus on Core Reliability:** We **de-prioritized complex, real-time fraud checks** and leveraged **existing fraud prevention mechanisms** applied during the post-payment reimbursement process as a fallback, ensuring the user experience was fast.
- **Iterative Error Handling:** To expedite the launch, the initial release **did not solve for all possible error codes.** Instead, we launched with solutions for the top failure scenarios, planning to address long-tail codes based on real-time production data.
- **Cross-functional Leadership:** I ensured alignment by providing the Design team with **real-life scenarios** for low-anxiety visuals and enabling the Engineering team with a **vendor sandbox environment** for rigorous API testing and error code validation.

## üìà Results & Impact: Delivering Seamless Cashless Service

The launch successfully eliminated a critical friction point, generating significant business value:

| **Metric Category** | **Impact & Measurement** |
| --- | --- |
| **Feature Adoption** | **100% of all users** engaging in in-clinic consultations at non-network hospitals used the feature. |
| **Business Growth** | Contributed to a X**% increase in overall revenue growth** from non-network services. |
| **Customer Retention** | The reduction in payment anxiety led to a **3.5% reduction in consultation cancellation percentage.** |
| **Operational Efficiency** | **Eliminated Agent Financial Risk** (no more using personal accounts) and **Automated Documentation** (prescriptions and claims settlement data were instantly captured). |
| **Consumer Experience** | **Drastically reduced escalations** to Operations and Customer Support teams regarding payment failures and wait times. |
